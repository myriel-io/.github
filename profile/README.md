## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, Iâ€™m David Myriel, Director of Developer Relations at Qdrant. 

I help developers make the most of vector search, bridging the gap between AI, machine learning, and real-world applications. 
Iâ€™ve got a background in technical writing, product education, and dev advocacy, and Iâ€™ve even bootstrapped a startupâ€”so I know the highs and lows of building something from scratch. 

These days, Iâ€™m diving into semantic search, observability, and AI infrastructure, sharing what I learn through writing, talks, and hands-on projects.
